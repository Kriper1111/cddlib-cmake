C-Library cddlib TO DO LIST
-----------------------------------------

1. Implement Union, Intersection, Minkowski Sum of two polyhedra.
   (should be quite trivial...)

2. Some people are running cdd twice to get a minimal representation
   of a polyhedron.   This can be done much more efficiently by
   running the LP code.  I should implement a function
   dd_MinimalRepresentation.
 
3. cddlib should handle errors.  
   (I need to learn good C-programming first...)

4. Make it faster.
   (Usually it is done automatically as time goes by...)

5. cddlib does not output the unique vertex (=origin) of
   a homogeneous cone.  In particular, if a homogeneous
   cone is bounded, cdd output nothing.  Maybe this behavior
   must change.
