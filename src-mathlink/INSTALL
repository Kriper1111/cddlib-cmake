This directory contains additional files necessary to
create cddmathlink.  It does not follow the autoconfig
structure and the user must edit Makefile so that it
conforms to the local Mathematica installation.
Once a correct Makefile is created, just type 
"make all" or "make ml".  

Before cddmathlink compilation, one must compile 
the cddlib library (libcdd.a) which is supposed to be 
in the lib-src directory.  It is perhaps necessary
to compile cddlib using the GNU gcc compiler.
